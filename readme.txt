= Key Features of Swipe =

* **Secure Login:** Sophisticated RSA encryption â€“ your login key lives on your phone. There is no back-door access, even for us.
* **Hide Login Form:** You can hide the login form for your site and use Swipe to scan a code with your phone (or other device). No passwords to remember!
* **No 3rd Party Integration:** Your login credentials are never saved on our end. All communication during authentication is between your phone and website.
* **Block Users:** Administrators can quick and easily block unwanted users in just a few clicks.
